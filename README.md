# Adding a Backend to a React App

This repo is a click counter that simply counts how many times a button has been clicked. Every click is registered in a database, and the client auto-refreshes every 5 seconds

## Running

This repo has two components: the client, and the server. You should run both at the same time.

### Client

1. `cd client`
2. `yarn` to install dependencies
3. `yarn start` to run the code

### Server

1. `cd server`
2. `npm install` to install dependencies
3. `node index.js` to run the code
